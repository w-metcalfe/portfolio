            <p class="header portDesc">Rainbow Six: Siege is a tactical first-person shooter focused on teamwork and communication. Players have a wide range of characters they can use, each possessing their own personal loadouts. In addition to the vast amount of characters available to use, Rainbow Six: Siege features an in-depth customization system, allowing players to change the look and feel of their characters in-game, including uniforms, weapon attachments, skins and charms. <br><br>
              While these options are organized by characters and weapons, charms are a global entity, meaning they are available to use on any character in-game. With the introduction of hundreds of new charms over the years, the organizational system has become outdated and confusing, featuring little to no organizational process at all.</p>
            <strong class="header portDesc">The Users</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">In order to consult and improve this process, I conducted a number of user tests and research activities to gather valuable user input on the matter. Taking feedback from both casual and competitive players,
              I amassed a considerable amount of user input that was used to craft the final product for my assignment. In order to avoid skewing my data, I broadened my user outreach to include people who had never played Rainbow Six: Siege before. I wanted to ensure my new and improved navigational system was accessible and easy to use by anyone.</p>
            <strong class="header portDesc">The Challenge</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">This assignment posed a considerable challenge: How might I create an information architecture from a large number of items featuring different styles? In order to keep myself from becoming overwhelmed with the vast amount of charms available in the game, I selected an excerpt of 30 charms that I thought represented the current organizational system well. Below you can find a list of the 30 charms available in my information architecture.</p>
            <img src="images/r6menu-list.png" alt="List of the 30 different charms used in the research study."> <br><br>
            <strong class="header portDesc">Open Card Sort</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">My research started out with a simple card sort. I wanted to see exactly how users perceived the content I was providing them. <br><br>
              In addition to my card sort, I also included a post-assessment questionnaire to gauge my participant’s choice, including reasons why players equip certain charms. Is it for the rarity? The appearance? The colour? I also took this time to have participants rate the effectiveness of the current charm rarity system available in-game, where a whopping 100% of users recorded a negative rating. While I had a feeling the current system would receive a bad rating, I didn’t think it would be this extreme. This pointed out a major warning sign in my research; something needs to change with the current rarity system.</p>
            <strong class="header portDesc">The Results</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">The results taken from my open card sort showed that I was on the right track. With a 70% agreement rate, the categories created by participants gave me great insight into how I should organize my information architecture. <br><br>
              I also learned a great deal from my post-assessment questions. In addition to my question regarding the current rarity system, I also wanted to gauge users on why they were equipping certain charms. This data was incredibly useful as it provided me with a recurring theme: most users equip charms that suit the rest of their customization options. I was beginning to understand why my participants rated the rarity system so poorly; players don’t care about the rarity of the charm, but rather what the charm looks like altogether. It was at this moment I realized I needed to set up a filter system in order to allow users to find the exact charm they are looking for with ease.</p>
              <strong class="header portDesc">Tree Test</strong>
              <p class="header portDesc">My initial open card sorts set me up in a great position for tree testing. With a 70% agreement rate, I knew that I could depend on most of the categories created by my participants. I created a navigational system, including categories and sub-categories, and set up a tree testing assignment online. My assessment included 3 simple tasks: <br><br>
                1. You have a red weapon skin equipped. Find and equip a charm that you feel would suit well. <br><br>
                2. You have been playing the operator Ash a lot and realized you don’t have any charms equipped on her. Find and equip a charm that you feel would suit well. <br><br>
                3. New Years is fast approaching, time to get into the spirit! Find and equip a charm that you feel would suit well.</p>
                <img src="images/r6menu-treetest.png" alt="Statistics showing the success and fail rate for each task.">
              <p class="header portDesc">As you can see from the statistics included above, I saw a favourable amount of success in my tasks. The only task that seemed to trip up participants was task 2, which I assume was mainly because the question is geared towards people who have played the game. Participants who have never played Rainbow Six: Siege before may have trouble understanding the task.</p>
              <strong class="header portDesc">Reccomendations</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">Incorporating the data collected from both my open card sort as well as my tree testing, I found it imperative that the organizational system of the charm menu needs an overhaul. Due to the manner of charms being a global asset, there needs to be some sort of navigation or filter system in place. There are simply too many charms to not have an organizational system. <br><br>
            To achieve this, I laid out a number of reccomendations for Ubisoft to consider: <br><br>
          <strong>Filter System</strong> - My first recommendation is to replace the pre-existing rarity system with well-structured charm filter. While a navigation could work nicely, it benefits known-item searches over unknown-item searches. As I learned from my open card sort, the majority of users are performing unknown-item searches; they have an idea of what kind of charm they would like to equip, but they do not know the exact charm they would like to use. <br><br>
          The filter system would allow users to filter their searches in up to 3 ways: by category, by sub-category, and by colour. As I learned from my open card sort, colours are very important to users. For this reason, I wanted to make it as easy as possible to find charms of a certain colour. The main category filter would feature the main labels taken from my tree testing session: content creators, countries, events, miscellaneous, operators, ranked and Ubisoft. Users can restrict their search even further by enabling or disabling sub-category filters. These filters would be dependant on what main category filters you have enabled. <br><br>
        <strong>Search System</strong> - My second recommendation is to include a search system allowing users to bypass the filter system and find exactly what they are looking for. Due to the wide variety of names for charms, it is imperative that a controlled vocabulary is created to accommodate for different styles of searches. For example, the motorcycle charm is actually called “Flash Drive” in-game, however, a simple search for motorcycle should find the charm for the user as well. This would be done through preferred and variant terms. <br><br>
        The key to any successful search system is a powerful controlled vocabulary that accommodates a wide range of terms and phrases. Since colour plays a massive part in user’s searches, it is imperative to incorporate colour searches as well. A search for “red flag” would find any flag charms that are tagged with the colour red. A search for “gold chibi” would find any chibi charms tagged with the colour gold.</p>

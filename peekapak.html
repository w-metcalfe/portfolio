            <p class="header portDesc">During my time at Peekapak I focused on human-centred design to help ship a multitude of products, including the all-new Middle School curriculum.</p>
            
            <strong class="header portDesc">Middle School Product</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">Understanding the significance of SEL in supporting students' emotional well-being and academic success, we embarked on a mission to create a curriculum specifically tailored to the unique needs and developmental stage of middle schoolers. Building upon the success of the elementary curriculum, we harnessed its foundational SEL properties and expanded upon them to ensure relevance and effectiveness for this specific age group. <br><br>

              Central to the Middle School Product is the integration of human stories as a means to convey SEL concepts in a relatable and compelling way. We meticulously collected a wide array of informative SEL stories and collaborated closely with educators to extract key SEL information, ensuring that the curriculum effectively addresses the developmental needs of middle school students. <br><br>
            
              By intertwining these human stories throughout the curriculum, we transform abstract SEL concepts into tangible, real-life scenarios that resonate with students. This approach fosters empathy, self-reflection, and critical thinking, allowing students to internalize SEL properties in a meaningful and memorable manner. <br><br>
            
              To gauge students' progress and comprehension, the Middle School Product incorporates interactive quizzes and response mechanisms. These assessments serve as valuable tools for educators to track individual student growth, identify areas for additional support, and tailor instruction accordingly. Moreover, the inclusion of student responses promotes self-expression and encourages active engagement, creating a collaborative learning environment.</p>

            <strong class="header portDesc">Progress Reporting Dashboard</strong>
            <p class="header portDesc">Through a series of preliminary user interviews with educators, we learned the importance of comprehensive student progress monitoring within the learning process. Having the ability to view their students progress at a quick glance is a top priority for educators as it helps them identify those who may be struggling. <br><br>

              Understanding the significance of student progress tracking within the learning process, we recognized the need to empower educators with a quick and comprehensive overview of their students' development. The Student Progress Reporting Dashboard offers educators an intuitive and user-friendly interface that provides real-time data on students' progress through units, their mastery of social-emotional learning (SEL) skills, reading levels, and comprehension. <br><br>
              
              With the ability to view their students' progress at a glance, educators can easily identify those who may be struggling or require additional support. The dashboard presents clear and concise information, allowing educators to identify specific areas where students may need extra help or guidance. By understanding individual student needs, educators can design targeted interventions and deliver personalized instruction that addresses students' unique challenges, fostering growth and ensuring academic success. <br><br>
              
              Through the Reports tab within the class dashboard, educators can seamlessly track and monitor their students' growth over time. The comprehensive reports provide valuable insights into students' SEL skill development, reading progress, and comprehension levels. Educators can access detailed information on individual student performance, allowing them to identify trends, celebrate achievements, and identify areas for improvement. <br><br>

              <strong class="header portDesc">Revamped Peekapak Library</strong>
              <p class="header portDesc">With the launch of our Middle School product, we recognized the need to address technical limitations within the current library system. Our goal was to reimagine its functionality and create a new approach that would allow for seamless content mixing between both curriculums while introducing an effective filtration system to enhance educators' ability to find the content they need effortlessly. <br><br>
  
                To achieve this, we embarked on a meticulous process of research and user testing. Through a combination of open and closed card sorting sessions, we gathered invaluable insights that informed the development of a functional information architecture. This architecture formed the foundation for our revamped library, ensuring a streamlined and intuitive user experience for educators. <br><br>
                
                The revamped library features an enhanced filtration system that enables educators to easily locate the specific content they are looking for. Whether it's a particular topic, skill, or resource type, the filtration system allows for efficient content discovery, saving educators valuable time and effort in their lesson planning process. <br><br>
                
                Building upon our existing unit locking and unlocking mechanisms, we integrated these features directly into the library. This integration empowers educators with greater control over content access, allowing them to personalize learning experiences for their students. By locking and unlocking units within the library, educators can curate content and tailor lessons to meet the unique needs and pace of their students, fostering a dynamic and engaging classroom environment. <br><br>

                <strong class="header portDesc">School & District Reporting Dashboard</strong>
                <p class="header portDesc">Recognizing the importance of student progress tracking for educators, we quickly realized that school and district administrators also sought a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of our programs at a larger scale. The School and District Reporting Dashboard provides administrators with a holistic view of educator and student engagement across various levels. Administrators can easily assess the overall usage and adoption of Peekapak products within their schools and districts, enabling them to identify trends, pinpoint areas of improvement, and make data-informed decisions to support continuous growth. <br><br>
    
                  Through the dashboard, administrators can access comprehensive data on educator engagement, empowering them to understand how individual teachers are integrating Peekapak into their instruction. This level of visibility allows administrators to recognize effective practices, provide targeted support, and facilitate ongoing professional development opportunities to further enhance educators' instructional strategies. <br><br>
                  
                  Furthermore, the reporting dashboard enables administrators to monitor student engagement and progress at both the individual and group levels. Administrators can track students' activity levels, identify patterns of engagement, and gain valuable insights into how students are benefiting from Peekapak's social-emotional learning programs. This information enables administrators to intervene when necessary, provide additional resources, and celebrate the successes of students and educators alike. <br><br>
                  
                  Additionally, the dashboard provides administrators with comprehensive registration, login, and time analytics, offering valuable metrics to assess platform usage and overall participation. These insights enable administrators to evaluate the reach and impact of Peekapak programs, supporting data-driven decision-making and ensuring the effective allocation of resources. <br><br>

                  <strong class="header portDesc">Revamped Avatar Builder</strong>
                  <p class="header portDesc">Among the most enjoyable features reported by educators and loved by students was the customizability of myPeekaville, specifically the ability to personalize avatars and rooms. Recognizing the importance of this feature in fostering student engagement and ownership over their learning journey, we set out to expand and revamp the entire avatar builder, providing students with an array of new items and accessories to choose from. <br><br>
      
                    In response to student desires for greater customization options, we introduced an extensive range of new items to the avatar builder. Students can now select from a variety of hats, glasses, and shoes, as well as explore an expanded collection of shirts and pants. To allow for even more personalization, we introduced a range of new hair colors, enabling students to create avatars that truly represent their unique personalities and preferences.<br><br>
                    
                    To ensure a seamless user experience, we carefully crafted an effective information architecture through a series of open and closed card sorting sessions. This architecture categorizes the new items in a logical and intuitive manner, making it easy for students to navigate and select the elements that best resonate with them. The revamped UI brings these enhancements to life, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that encourages creativity and self-expression. <br><br>
